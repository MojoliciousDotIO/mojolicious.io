# This is the site configuration file. The format is YAML, and the config is
# read by Beam::Wire, a dependency-injection library that builds complete
# objects. For full details on how to edit this file, see
# Statocles::Help::Config.
#
# This file contains configuration for objects. Each object has a name, like
# "site", "theme", or "blog_app". This name can be used to refer to the object
# later, for example, using "$ref: name".
#
# Every object has a "class". Developers can customize behavior by changing the
# class or creating their own classes. If you need help with an object, look at
# the class's documentation.
#
# Every object has "args", which are the object's attributes. See the class's
# documentation for a full list of attributes and what they do.
#
# Many objects have events. Event handlers can be configured using the "on"
# key. See the class's documentation for a list of possible events. Every
# event handler should have at least "$class" and a "$sub". "$class" is the
# plugin class. "$sub" is the plugin method to run. If necessary, you can
# add "$args" to configure the plugin object.

# site: This is the main site object. Site objects handle building and
# deploying, and store global site data like themes and navigation. See
# Statocles::Site for a full list of attributes and what they do.
