                <h2>Create new, complex Promises by composing Promises</h2>

<p>Mojolicious 7.49 added an its own implementation of the <a href="https://promisesaplus.com">Promises/A+ specification</a>. mohawk wrote about these in <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/14/day-14-you-promised-to-call/">Day 14: You Promised To Call!</a> of the 2017 Mojolicious Advent Calender where he showed you how to fetch many webpages concurrently. This Advent entry extends that with  more Promise tricks.</p>

                <p>Developing webapps with <a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a> is a lot of fun!
Using <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/morbo">the <code>morbo</code> server</a> for
development, every change to my webapp causes a restart to load my changes.
This way the next request I make has all my new code!</p>

<p>So, I change my code, the webapp restarts, and I go back to my browser window.
Wait... Where&#39;s my new code? Why isn&#39;t the bug fixed? Did... Did I forget to
reload my browser window again? Ugh! Of course!</p>

<p>Does this happen to you? Probably not. But, it&#39;s still annoying to reload the
browser window after every backend code change. It&#39;d be nice if my browser
window automatically reloaded every time the web server restarted!</p>

                <p>Welcome to another year of the Mojolicious Advent Calendar!
2018 has been very good to Mojolicious and I could think of no better way to kick off this calendar than with a recap of the 2018 Nordic Perl Workshop and MojoConf held in Oslo, Norway.</p>

                <p>Over the course of this advent calendar, we have discussed the <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/tag/wishlist/">Wishlist example application</a> several times.
We used it to motivate discussions about <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/17/day-17-the-wishlist-app/">templates</a>, <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/18/day-18-the-wishlist-model/">models</a>, <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/19/day-19-make-your-app-installable/">installable apps</a>, and <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/20/day-20-practical-testing/">testing</a>.
In this post I want to use it somewhat differently.
I would like to motivate you, the reader, into action in a few different ways.</p>

            <title>Day 23: One-Liners for Fun and Profit</title>
            <link>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/23/day-23-one-liners-for-fun-and-profit/</link>
            <guid>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/23/day-23-one-liners-for-fun-and-profit/</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Perl is well-known for its <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/download/perl1line.txt">one-liners</a>: short programs written as part of the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html">command line invocation of the interpreter</a>.
Certainly every programmer or sysadmin has the need, from time to time, to do a quick one-off task programmatically.
Such tasks can be done with a full script, to be sure, but once you get the hang of writing them, one-liners can save the time and hassle of actually doing so.</p>

<p>These tasks may include removing unwanted lines from files, collecting data from logs, or even a quick proof-of-concept of something that would become a script later.
They can read lines in files, even multiple files, can operate on files in-place, can read from STDIN as a pipe.
But while one-liners have been tools of the trade for these activities, certainly no such thing would be practical for web tasks, right?</p>

<p>But of course, on <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/05/day-5-your-apps-built-in-commands/">day 5</a> and <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/06/day-6-adding-your-own-commands/">day 6</a> of this series that we saw that we can build command line tools with your app.
We have even seen how to use the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/eval">eval</a> command to run a one-liner against your app.
So could we take this further?</p>

<p>Could we do remote data fetching and manipulation as a one-liner?
Could we build an entire web application as a one-liner?
Would I be asking if the answer was no?</p>

                    <p><a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/23/day-23-one-liners-for-fun-and-profit/#section-2">Continue reading...</a></p>
