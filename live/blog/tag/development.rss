                <p><a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a> is an <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Growing#Model-View-Controller">MVC
framework</a>.
But, unlike <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org">Catalyst</a>, Mojolicious
does not provide a model API. This is a good thing: Mojolicious works
well with any model layer, including the existing models used by your
current application.</p>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> is a popular model
layer for Mojolicious applications. DBIx::Class (or &quot;DBIC&quot;) is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object-Relational Mapper
(ORM)</a> to map
objects onto a relational database. This allows for a well-organized
model layer, and a standard API to access the data.</p>

<p>For those who read last month&#39;s posts on <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/01/21/writing-reusable-controllers/">Writing Reusable
Controllers</a> and
<a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/01/28/writing-extensible-controllers/">Writing Extensible
Controllers</a>, this
post introduces the end result of those posts: The <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::DBIC">Mojolicious DBIC
Plugin</a>. This plugin
makes it easier to start using DBIx::Class with Mojolicious.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Once I have a <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/01/21/writing-reusable-controllers">reusable
controller</a>, how do
I extend it? Object-oriented programming gives me a couple ways of
extending a controller through code: Inheritance and composition. But,
we need to write our controller so that it&#39;s easy to inherit or compose.</p>

<h1>Don&#39;t Render, Stash</h1>

<p>First, this means we shouldn&#39;t call <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Controller#render">the <code>render</code>
method</a>
ourselves (unless we have a good reason, but we&#39;ll get to that later).
The <code>render</code> method can only ever be called once, so we should only call
it after we&#39;ve gathered all the data we want.</p>

<pre><code># This method cannot easily be used by a subclass, since it explicitly
# calls render()
sub list {
    my ( $c ) = @_;
    my $resultset_class = $c-&gt;stash( &#39;resultset&#39; );
    my $resultset = $c-&gt;schema-&gt;resultset( $resultset_class );
    $c-&gt;render(
        resultset =&gt; $resultset,
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, to make sure I don&#39;t call <code>render</code> too early, and to make sure
subclasses can use the data from my superclass, I instead put all the
data directly in to the stash with the <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Controller#stash"><code>stash()</code>
method</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>In all the web applications I&#39;ve written with
<a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a>, one of the most mis-used features
are controllers. Mojolicious is
a <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Growing#Model-View-Controller">Model-View-Controller</a>
framework, and the MVC pattern is intended to provide for code re-use.</p>

<p>Models can be interchangeable and used by the same controllers and
templates. With a common, consistent model API, the right controller can
list any data, update any data. If all of our models have a method named
&quot;search&quot;, I can make a single controller method that will run a search
on any of them.</p>

<p>The easiest way to demonstrate this is with
<a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a>. DBIx::Class provides
a consistent API for a relational database. </p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>For this example, I&#39;ll use <a href="https://github.com/preaction/Mojolicious-Plugin-DBIC/tree/master/t/lib/Local">this DBIx::Class
schema</a>.
My schema has a couple tables: <code>notes</code> for storing simple notes, and
<code>events</code> for storing calendar events.</p>

            <title>Day 12: Using Minion in Dancer Apps</title>
            <link>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/12/dancer-and-minion/</link>
            <guid>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/12/dancer-and-minion/</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>At <code>$work</code>, we have built an API with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer">Dancer</a> that generates PDF documents and XML files. This API is a critical component of an insurance enrollment system: PDFs are generated to deliver to the client in a web browser
immediately, and the XML is delivered to the carrier as soon as it becomes available. Since the XML often takes a significant amount of time to generate, the job is generated in the background so as not to tie up the
application server for an extended amount of time. When this was done, a homegrown process management system was developed, and works by <code>fork()</code>ing a process, tracking its pid, and hoping we can later successfully
reap the completed process.</p>

<p>There have been several problems with this approach:
- it&#39;s fragile
- it doesn&#39;t scale
- it&#39;s too easy to screw something up as a developer</p>

<p>In 2019, we have to ramp up to take on a significantly larger workload. The current solution simply will not handle the amount of work we anticipate needing to handle. Enter <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Minion">Minion</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The techniques used in this article work equally well with Dancer or <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2">Dancer2</a>.</p>

            <title>Day 7: MetaCPAN, Mojolicious and OpenAPI</title>
            <link>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/07/openapi/</link>

                <p>During this years <a href="http://www.olafalders.com/2018/11/21/metahack-3-wrap-report/">meta::hack 3</a>, I was extremely fortunate to work with <a href="https://twitter.com/joelaberger">Joel Berger</a> on integrating/documenting OpenAPI with the MetaCPAN API via Mojolicious.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>OpenAPI is a specification for designing, documenting, validating and driving your RESTful API. It can be used to provide documentation to an existing API, or when creating a new one.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI Specification originated as the Swagger specification and was renamed to separate the API description format (OpenAPI) from the open source tooling (Swagger). The specification moved into a new GitHub repository, but did not change.</p>

<p>In the case of the MetaCPAN API, we set out to provide documentation to the existing API, but quickly moved into supporting validation to API calls as well.</p>
