                <p>One of the things we know from years of programming is that you should never hard-code anything if you don&#39;t have to.
And yet far too many web application hard-code their urls, especially internal ones.
But what if you didn&#39;t have to?</p>

<p>Each Mojolicious route has its own <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Routing#Named-routes">name</a> which can be used to generate urls.
If you don&#39;t specify one, one is generated, but you shouldn&#39;t rely on that name, give it one that is meaningful and relevant to your purposes.
In lite apps, the name is the last parameter, after any defaults or callbacks.
(In a full app it is an attribute, but we&#39;ll talk about those in another post).</p>

<p>Then when you need a url, rather than hard-coding it, use <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Controller#url_for"><code>url_for</code></a> or related functionality to generate a url by name, you can even pass placeholder values if needed.
Let&#39;s see how it works!</p>
