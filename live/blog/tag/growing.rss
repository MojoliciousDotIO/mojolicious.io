            <title>Day 4: Don&#39;t Fear the Full App</title>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>One of the most common misconceptions about Mojolicious is that there is a large difference between the declarative &quot;Lite&quot; apps that we have seen so far and large-scale structured &quot;Full&quot; apps.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
<a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Lite">Mojolicious::Lite</a> is a very tiny wrapper around the so-called &quot;Full&quot; app architecture, giving it the approachable keyword syntax.</p>

<p>Because it is much nicer to have concise single-file examples for documentation most of Mojolicious&#39; documentation uses Lite syntax most of the time.
It is understandable that people worry about migrating (or as we call it &quot;growing&quot;) even once their apps would benefit from Object-Oriented structure; after all the docs seem geared towards Lite apps.
However, let those fears go, the transition is easy.
And once you understand it, the documentatation examples are trivial to translate.</p>

<p>Plus, Mojolicious comes with two forms of help when transitioning.
The first is the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Growing">Growing Guide</a> which covers everything this post will but from the perspective of porting an existing application (which I won&#39;t duplicate here).
The second is the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/inflate">inflate command</a> which can even start you on the process by moving your templates from the data section and into their own files.</p>

<p>That said, in order to futher demystify things, I&#39;m going to cover some of the differences and pull back the curtain on the Lite syntax itself.</p>
