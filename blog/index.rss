            <title>Announcing Core async/await</title>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>For years one of my primary tasks as a Mojolicious Core Team member has been to teach Mojolicious users the ins and outs of asynchronous programming.
We have championed several patterns to tame the beast and clean up async code, including continuation passing, promises and now async/await.
But while promises were a noted improvement over continuation passing, it is becoming more and more clear that the async/await pattern is a paradigm shift in asynchronous programming semantics.</p>

<p>I personally believe that it is far and away the easiest way to do nonblocking code in modern languages.
It might even reach the extent that languages and/or frameworks that do not support it are going to be in real trouble as new user will expect it to be available.
With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await">so many different languages</a> adopting the pattern, soon many may not have even been exposed to &quot;the old ways&quot; at all!</p>

<p>Last year, during the 2018 Mojolicious Advent Calendar, I <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/24/async-await-the-mojo-way/">introduced</a> my <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::AsyncAwait">Mojo::AsyncAwait</a> library which was intended to address the immediate need for the Mojolicious community, based on the Mojolicious core promise module <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojo/Promise">Mojo::Promise</a>.
It did rely on a &quot;controversial&quot; module (<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Coro">Coro</a>) to accomplish its task, and therefore it was not a good candidate for all users.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, others in the Perl community were noticing as well.
Paul Evans (LeoNerd) applied for and received <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_futureasyncawai">a grant</a> from The Perl Foundation to build a low-level async/await mechanism for his <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Future">Future</a> promise library.
As that project has successfully culminated in <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Future::AsyncAwait">Future::AsyncAwait</a> on CPAN, the Mojolicious team has been engaging with Paul on a collaboration to allow Mojo::Promise to hook directly into it.</p>

<p>So without futher ado, the Mojolicious Core Team is very happy to announce that as of the most recent release of Mojolicious, async/await is now a built-in framework feature!</p>

                <p><a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/07/01/a-reusable-view-layer/">Last week I went over how to configure and include
templates</a>. This
is a pretty standard procedural solution: My current template calls
another template. But what if I need to pass additional data to my
layout template? Perhaps in addition to the content in my template,
I also have some <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to include, or some
<code>&lt;style&gt;</code> specific to this page. This would involve somehow passing data
&quot;up&quot;, or making the data available for the layout template to use.
<a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a> provides a way to do this: <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Rendering#Content-blocks">named
content
blocks</a>.</p>

            <title>A Reusable View Layer</title>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>In a well-designed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller">Model-View-Controller</a>
web application, most of the code and the development time will be in
the model layer (which contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic">business
logic</a>). The other two
layers are meant to be as re-usable as possible. Earlier this year
I discussed how to build a <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/01/21/writing-reusable-controllers/">reusable controller for
Mojolicious</a>
and how to <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/01/28/writing-extensible-controllers/">build an inheritable controller to increase code
re-use</a>.
Now, I&#39;d like to talk about how the <a href="https://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious web
framework</a> provides ways to reuse, combine, and
compose the view code: <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Tutorial#Stash-and-templates">the
stash</a>,
<a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Rendering#Partial-templates">includes</a>,
<a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Rendering#Layouts">layout
templates</a>,
and <a href="https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Rendering#Content-blocks">named content
blocks</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I&#39;ll talk about how to make reusable, configurable,
composable templates.</p>

            <title>Yancy&#39;s Static Backend</title>
            <link>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/06/02/yancys-static-backend/</link>
            <guid>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/06/02/yancys-static-backend/</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Back a few months ago I wrote about <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/17/a-website-for-yancy/">making a website for the Yancy
CMS</a> that
included a basic Markdown page editor, <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/18/a-view-to-a-pod/">adding a documentation viewer
with the Mojolicious PODViewer
plugin</a>, and
<a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2018/12/19/you-only-export-twice/">deploying a static version of the site using the Mojolicious <code>export</code>
command</a>.
The site uses a SQLite database, which makes it very easy to set up and
use the Yancy editor, but very difficult to work with the data any other
way...</p>

<p>To solve this problem, many people have taken to writing their website
as a set of static files and using a static site generator to add
templates and plugins to build their website. Each page has a header
section that defines some metadata about the page, like the title or the
date it was posted. Instead of having each page be a row in a SQLite
database, each page in a static site is a file on the filesystem!</p>

<p>Yancy uses &quot;Backends&quot; to interface with a database. To make Yancy into
a static site generator, I wrote a backend that works with a flat-file
database made up of YAML and Markdown files:
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Yancy::Backend::Static">Yancy::Backend::Static</a>.
I can use this new backend to make my Yancy documentation site even
easier to edit!</p>

            <title>Testing Environment With Tmux</title>
            <link>https://mojolicious.io/blog/2019/04/15/testing-environment-with-tmux/</link>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>The <a href="http://preaction.me/yancy">Yancy CMS</a> for the <a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious web
framework</a> currently supports three different
database systems directly (and even more through <a href="http://dbix-class.org">the DBIx::Class
ORM</a>). As a result, when doing development,
I need to have two database daemons running locally, a bunch of
different environment variables to tell the tests where those databases
are, and a web daemon to test the front-end.</p>

<p>Setting up these daemons is a pain, but I also do not want to run them
all the time (to save on my laptop&#39;s battery). To me, it&#39;s easier to run
a database daemon for a specific project than to try to manage all the
databases I might need. But that means that every time I want to do some
work on Yancy, I need to start up a bunch of things.</p>

<p>Since I do all my development in a terminal window, <a href="http://tmux.github.io">the Tmux terminal
multiplexer</a> has become an extremely useful tool.
Using a shell script and Tmux, I can run a single command to set up all
the databases, environment variables, and all the tabs I need to get to
work quickly.</p>
