        <title>Day 23: One-Liners for Fun and Profit</title>

            <p>Perl is well-known for its <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/download/perl1line.txt">one-liners</a>: short programs written as part of the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html">command line invocation of the interpreter</a>.
Certainly every programmer or sysadmin has the need, from time to time, to do a quick one-off task programmatically.
Such tasks can be done with a full script, to be sure, but once you get the hang of writing them, one-liners can save the time and hassle of actually doing so.</p>

<p>These tasks may include removing unwanted lines from files, collecting data from logs, or even a quick proof-of-concept of something that would become a script later.
They can read lines in files, even multiple files, can operate on files in-place, can read from STDIN as a pipe.
But while one-liners have been tools of the trade for these activities, certainly no such thing would be practical for web tasks, right?</p>

<p>But of course, on <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/05/day-5-your-apps-built-in-commands/">day 5</a> and <a href="https://mojolicious.io/blog/2017/12/06/day-6-adding-your-own-commands/">day 6</a> of this series that we saw that we can build command line tools with your app.
We have even seen how to use the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/eval">eval</a> command to run a one-liner against your app.
So could we take this further?</p>

<p>Could we do remote data fetching and manipulation as a one-liner?
Could we build an entire web application as a one-liner?
Would I be asking if the answer was no?</p>

            <p>I mentioned at the outset of this series that Mojolicious applications are more than just web servers.
I then showed how you can start a web server using the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/daemon"><code>daemon</code></a> or <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/prefork"><code>prefork</code></a> commands.
In the previous post, I mentioned an <a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Command/inflate"><code>inflate</code></a> command that can help you with growing your app from Lite to Full.</p>

<p>But there are other commands, built right in to your app, that can help you be more productive right away!</p>
